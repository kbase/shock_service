Bio-KBase-Shock

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make install

Notes:

Make sure to use the KBase installed perl, not the system installed perl
when running perl Makefile.PL (ie. /kb/runtime/bin/perl Makefile.PL);

Using the KBase installed perl alone won't get the libs installed in the
right spot. The --prefix option to Makefile.PL should be used and set to
the value of $TARGET or $TARGET/lib (need to check which).
